in my project i am building an application that will help the user determine his BMI some of the feature in my project are:
created a class User with 3 methods: calculatebmi, errorlog and validateemail
implemented a log that record errors in a text file and save in the Cdrive
build a conversion tool(ex: lbs to KG)
use a regex expression to ensure email is always in the right format
calculate and display data based on an external factor
more features will be added gradually
